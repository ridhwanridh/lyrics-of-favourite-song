(I put his name in yellow hearts)</br>
She put my name with yellow hearts</br>
Her favorite color like the stars</br>
I didn't listen very hard</br>
When she told me she was crazy from the start</br>
I drive down open roads so slow</br>
Here comes the train, I'll let it go</br>
Ain't got nobody on my phone</br>
Don't like being all alone (Don't like being all alone)</br>
Not good at keeping with the trends (No, no)</br>
Too good at welcoming amends (No, no, no)</br>
It's been a while since I've heard her say</br>
That we were more than friends (Oh, just friends)</br>
Oh, I, I-I-I know a lot is going on</br>
But girl, please, tell me (Boy, tell me)</br>
And I'll let you be</br>
Are you still with me or not?</br>
She put my name with yellow hearts</br>
Her favorite color like the stars (Favorite color like the stars)</br>
I didn't listen very hard</br>
When she told me she was crazy from the start</br>
No matter what you say or what you do</br>
I can't really tell</br>
I'd rather keep you waiting, conversating</br>
Don't wanna be your muse or something you could lose</br>
I told you that I'm over it, but lately</br>
When they say, you better best believe me</br>
I could change the way that you receive that</br>
On my way to meet you in the evening</br>
Try to say the way that I've been feeling</br>
I've been lying, I've been holding my breath</br>
You think I'm always upset, when I'm not (Yeah)</br>
I've been lying, yellow hearts aren't just friends</br>
Now I don't need to pretend, try this again (Yeah, yeah)</br>
She put my name with yellow hearts (I put his name in yellow hearts</br>
Her favorite color like the stars (His favorite color like the stars)</br>
I didn't listen very hard (You didn't listen)</br>
When she told me she was crazy from the start</br>
She put my name with yellow hearts (I put, I put his name)</br>
I said she was a work of art (I thought they were all just the same)</br>
I didn't listen very hard (To you, what do they really mean?)</br>
When she told me she was crazy from the start (Have you only been playing games)</br>
(Mmm-hmm) Only been playing games</br>
(Haha, uh, yuh)</p>
